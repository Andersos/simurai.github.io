[The Letter-Heads](/projects/letter-heads/) is a __Firefox 4 demo__ that lets you experience interactive shadow art. Meet different characters made with letters and text-shadow. Animated with CSS3+JS. It's mainly inspired by shadow artist [Kumi Yamashita](http://www.kumiyamashita.com/light-and-shadow/).

The __Cursor Monster__ is a little __CSS3/JS__ toy that you can play around with. To hide the cursor once the monster eats it, you can use this CSS:

```css
cursor: none;
```

But be careful, it can be super confusing if you abuse it.

__Update__: Apparently Chrome will disable it in a future release, so enjoy while you can.
